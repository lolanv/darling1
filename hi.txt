Create the following in the functionalities section of the code .

An adaptor function that takes a container of 5 funtions and a data container of 5 strings values.The adaptor function
 must apply the the ith data value in the data container and prints the result in the adaptor function itself

Each function should be of the following
        input parameter: one string by value 
        outpul parameter: void

Note: Each function is to be applied on only a single value based on index position

2. Create a top level function that accepts ine string and prints "string has atleast 3 vowels" or not enough vowels" depending on whether the string 
containes atleast 3 vowels characters or not

3. Create a top level function that accepts on string and print wheter " string starts with c++" or "Does not have C++ prefix " based on wheater string
 value starts with the characters "C++" or not

4. Create a top level function that aceepts a string value and prints the last 3 characters of the string value
        Note: Consider the lack of 3 charcters in the input string as an invalid output

5. Create a topt level function that aceepts a string and prints  
        a. The length of the string if the string starts with the letter "a" or "b"
        b. A message "invalid string" for anny string that starts with space character.
        c. The first 2 characters of the string otherwise
    Note: HAndle relevent exception scenarios too

6. Create a top level function that accepts a string and prints 
        a.The first 2 consecutively repeated characters of the string if the sting has such a set .
        b.The last 2 characters of the string if such a set of characters do not exists.
                For example:
                        For a string "abccdda", output should be "cc" (first 2 charactets that are repeated in the string).
                        For a string "abcdade", output should be ae(lst 2 characters of the string since no characters are repeated consecutively).
    Note: A blank or length 1 string is to be treated  as invalid 

Execute function 2,3,4,5 and 6 by passing them in a container to the adaptor along with 6 string values in a container

Create a function.h and cpp and execute it in the main.cpp
if it is possible make exceptions files also if in use
