/*
Create a class Data Handler with the following functions

_data which is an an array of 5 integer value
_result which is an array of 5 integer values.

         A member function FilterData that accepts a lamda predicate and displayes all value from _data that satisfy the predicate condition
         For eg. _data = {1,2,3,4,5} and lamda  = [](int num) {return num%4 ==0;} displays output as 4.

          A member function SumOfEven which display the sum of add numbers in the _data array.

         for eg. _data = {1,2,3,4,5} display as 9

         Overload << operator for this class

         A function ComputerSqaure that stores for each of the numbers in an array (passed via an argument to the thread at the time of invocation of  thread)
        and stores it in a result vector

        A function to display the values of _result vector. This function must only be executed after a signal is recieved from the ComputerSquare to  this 
        function indicating "value are ready for consumption". Make suitable arrangments for the same.


        A function that stores the cube of each of the numbers in an array (passed via an argument to the thread at the time of invocation of thread) 
        and prints it to the console log.

        Create approropriate special member functions instantiate an object of the class DataHandler. Ensure that only one object for this class can exists
       at any given time in the program

       Note : 
       1. HAndle all relevent exceptions

       2. Execute all member functions by seprate thread instances.You should use an array of threads to manage threads instanes created.

       3. Demonstrate the output of all functionalities with appropriate client code
